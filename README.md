# COMP1010-ASSIGNMENT-REPOSITORY
We have chosen to do Topic 4: Soccer League Management for our assignment. We have a knockout tournament with 4 teams playing, consisting of 2 rounds. 

CLIENT:
4 teams and 11 players on each team, are selected randomly from 2 arrays. 
The objects team1, team2, team3, team4, contain the randomised team name and player names.
We also used for loops to iterate through the loops and select 11 random players for each team.
